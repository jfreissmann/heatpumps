# heatpumps

Steady-state simulation of design and partload operation of a wide collection of heat pump topologies.

## Key Features

  - Steady-state simulation of design and partload operation based on [TESPy](https://github.com/oemof/tespy)
  - Parametrization and result visualisation through a [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) dashboard
  - Industry standard, as well as topologies still in research and developement, supported
  - Sub- and transcritical processes
  - Wide variety of refrigerants due to the integration of [CoolProp](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp)

## Installation

For now, only direct download from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jfreissmann/heatpumps) is supported, so just clone it locally or download a ZIP file of the code.  If you are using [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), you can create and activate a clean environment like this:

```
conda create -n my_new_env python=3.11
```

```
conda activate my_new_env
```

If you want to build the package locally and install it, you should use these commands from the root directory of the repository:

```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

```
python -m pip install .
```

If you want to use an editable version of the package, e.g. if you want to contribute to the project and test your own changes, skip the commands above and use this one:

```
python -m pip install -e "path/to/the/heatpumps/dir/"
```

## Run the dashboard

The heatpumps package comes with a command to run the dashboard directly from your terminal. Running the dashboard is as easy as typing the following command:

```
heatpumps-dashboard
```

## Using the heat pump model classes

To use the heat pump model classes in your own scripts, you can import them as follows:

```python
from heatpumps.models import HeatPumpSimple, HeatPumpEconIHX
from heatpumps.parameters import get_params

# Simple cycle model
params = get_params('HeatPumpSimple')

params['setup']['refrig'] = 'R1234yf'
params['fluids']['wf'] = 'R1234yf'

params['C3']['T'] = 85  # feed flow temperature of heat sink
params['C1']['T'] = 50  # return flow temperature of heat sink

hp = HeatPumpSimple(params=params)

hp.run_model()
hp.generate_state_diagram(diagram_type='logph', savefig=True, open_file=True)

# Serial compression with closed economizer and internal heat exchanger
econ_type = 'closed'
params = get_params('HeatPumpEconIHX', econ_type=econ_type)

params['ihx']['dT_sh'] = 7.5  # superheating by internal heat exchanger

hp = HeatPumpEconIHX(params=params, econ_type=econ_type)

hp.run_model()
hp.perform_exergy_analysis(print_results=True)
```
