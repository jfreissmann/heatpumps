"\n"
"            The heat pump simulator *heatpumps* is a powerful simulation software\n"
"            for analyzing and evaluating heat pumps.\n"
"\n"
"            This dashboard allows you to control a variety of complex\n"
"            thermodynamic plant models using numerical methods via a\n"
"            simple interface, without requiring expert knowledge.\n"
"            This includes both the design of heat pumps\n"
"            as well as the simulation of their steady-state part load operation. The\n"
"            simulation results provide insights into the pump's behavior, COP,\n"
"            state variables, and costs of individual components as well as\n"
"            total investment costs. This enables access to complex questions\n"
"            that frequently arise in the design and planning of heat pumps.\n"
"\n"
"            ### Key Features\n"
"\n"
"            - Steady-state design and part load simulation based on [TESPy](https://github.com/oemof/tespy)\n"
"            - Parameterization and result visualization via a [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) dashboard\n"
"            - Common circuit topologies used in industry, research, and development\n"
"            - Subcritical and transcritical processes\n"
"            - Large selection of working fluids thanks to [CoolProp](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp) integration\n"

"\n"
"                #### Used Software:\n"
"\n"
"                The open-source software TESPy is used for modeling and simulating the systems.\n"
"                Additionally, a number of other Python packages are used for data processing,\n"
"                preparation, and visualization.\n"
"\n"
"                ---\n"
"\n"
"                #### TESPy:\n"
"\n"
"                TESPy (Thermal Engineering Systems in Python) is a powerful\n"
"                simulation tool for thermal process engineering, such as power plants,\n"
"                district heating systems, or heat pumps. The TESPy package allows for\n"
"                system design and steady-state operation simulation. After that,\n"
"                part load behavior can be determined based on the characteristics of\n"
"                each component of the system. The component-based structure combined\n"
"                with the solution method offers great flexibility regarding the\n"
"                system topology and parameterization. More information on TESPy can\n"
"                be found in its [online documentation](https://tespy.readthedocs.io) (in English).\n"
"\n"
"                #### Other Packages:\n"

"                - [NumPy](https://numpy.org) (Data Processing)\n"
"                - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) (Data Processing)\n"

"\n"

"                In some cases, it is not possible to account for all possible influences,\n"
"                so deviations from real-world experience may occur and should be taken into\n"
"                account when evaluating the results. The results provide sufficient to exact\n"

"                    for your heat pump. In the left sidebar, next to the\n"
"                    dimensioning and the choice of refrigerant, several central parameters\n"
"                    for the cycle process must be specified.\n"
"\n"
"                    These include, for example, the temperatures of the heat source and sink,\n"
"                    but also the associated network pressures. Additionally, an internal\n"
"                    heat exchanger can be optionally added. The resulting superheat of the\n"
"                    evaporated refrigerant must also be specified.\n"
"\n"
"                    Once the design simulation is successfully completed, the\n"
"                    generated results are processed graphically in state diagrams\n"
"                    and quantified. Key metrics such as the coefficient of performance (COP),\n"
"                    as well as relevant heat flows and power outputs, will be shown.\n"
"                    Furthermore, thermodynamic state variables at each process step will\n"
"                    be listed in a table.\n"
"\n"
"                    After the design simulation, a button will appear allowing you to switch\n"
"                    to the partial load interface. This can also be done via the\n"
"                    dropdown menu in the sidebar. Information on how to perform\n"
